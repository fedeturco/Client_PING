# Info
## Homepage

This application is useful to keep track of devices in your network at work or at home. You can import or insert a list of devices, keeping track of their pings.
Tha table sows the status of the ping and the last successful response received from the device. When you select a device, with the buttons below you can 
launch your specific application on the target device, for example an ssh/ftp/scp/... client, open the device in the browser or simply start a ping -t prompt.
It becomes very handy when you have to keep track of a list of PLCs at work or check the online status of different gateways in your LAN.
